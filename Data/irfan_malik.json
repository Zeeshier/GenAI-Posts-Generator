However, in reality, only about 10% are genuinely leveraging AI, while the remaining 90% are simply displaying AI-like features but relying on conventional rule-based engines.\nI'm not saying this is the wrong approach, but here's how it should be done:\nThe first step is raising awareness and then finding the right partners to help implement AI. Next, you need to develop a research and development wing. With patience and consistency, that's when you'll start seeing real results, what we can truly call AI magic.",
